# NC A&T Hackathon 2024
Welcome students of the 2024 NC A&T Hackathon. This repository has been setup as an optional kickstarter for you to leverage if you wish. This repository is considered optional, however, it does include popular frameworks such as AngularJS, PrimeNG and Express. Using this starter template ideally would get you well underway with the Hackathon so you can focus on learning and implementing Views, Services and other foundational elements for a frontend web application.
